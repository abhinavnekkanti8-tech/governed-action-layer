# ADR-004: Publish Workflow to Skill

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Invokers (Apps/Agents) need a stable contract. Changing a workflow definition shouldn't break existing clients.

## Decision
"Publishing" a workflow creates an immutable **Skill Version**.
- It generates a strict **Input/Output JSON Schema**.
- It assigns a **Version** number.
- It calculates **Risk Tags**.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Strict contracts for consumers. Safe evolution of workflows.
- **Negative**: Requires a compile/publish step; no "hot reload" of definitions for consumers (a feature, not a bug).

# ADR-003: MVP Workflow Semantics

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a usable "thin slice" without building a full Turing-complete programming language in the builder.

## Decision
MVP Workflows will support:
1. **Sequential Execution**: Linear steps.
2. **Conditional Branching**: Simple `if/else` logic.
3. **Approvals**: Explicit wait states.
4. **Retries/Timeouts**: Basic configuration per step.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Simplifies the Builder UI and Execution logic significantly.
- **Negative**: Cannot handle complex parallel fork-join or loops in MVP.

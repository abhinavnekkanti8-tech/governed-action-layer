# ADR-006: RBAC Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need granular control over who can build, who can invoke, and who can approve.

## Decision
Implement RBAC with four roles:
- **Admin**: Full access.
- **Builder**: Create workflows, publish skills.
- **Operator**: Invoke skills, handle approvals.
- **Viewer**: Read-only audits/runs.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Covers 90% of business needs with low complexity.
- **Negative**: Not fully customisable (yet).

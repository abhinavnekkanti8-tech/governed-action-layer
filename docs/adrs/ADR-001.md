# ADR-001: Split Service Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to serve distinct user groups: Builders (defining workflows), Applications/Agents (invoking them), and Operators (managing approvals).

## Decision
We will implement three separate backend services:
1. **Control Plane API**: For workflow definition, management, and publishing.
2. **Execution Plane API**: For high-scale invocation, state management, and auditing.
3. **Agent Gateway**: A dedicated MCP server to interface with LLM agents.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear separation of concerns; Independent scaling; Security isolation (Agent gateway can be sandboxed).
- **Negative**: Higher operational complexity than a monolith; Need for shared libraries (types/contracts).

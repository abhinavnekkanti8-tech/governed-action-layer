# ADR-008: AI Step Validation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AI models are non-deterministic. We need to ensure workflow reliability.

## Decision
AI Decision/Routing steps must output **Validated JSON**.
- We will use strict schema validation.
- Invalid output triggers a fallback or failure, rather than progressing with bad data.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Prevents "hallucinated" routes or data structures.
- **Negative**: Might require retry logic for the LLM generation.

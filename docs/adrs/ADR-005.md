# ADR-005: Authentication via API Keys

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to demonstrate auth without the complexity of a full OIDC setup for the first milestone.

## Decision
We will use **API Keys** (`x-api-key` header) linking to a Principal.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Easy to implement and test (curl/Postman/MCP).
- **Negative**: Key management security burden; will need migration to OIDC/SSO later.

# ADR-002: Temporal for Durable Execution

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Workflows require reliability, retries, and the ability to wait effectively for human approval (which may take hours or days).

## Decision
We will use **Temporal** as the workflow engine.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Out-of-the-box durability, retries, and "signals" for approval interactions. Solves the "resume execution" problem.
- **Negative**: Adds infrastructure dependency (Temporal Server + Cassandra/Postgres).

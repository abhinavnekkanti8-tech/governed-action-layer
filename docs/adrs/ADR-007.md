# ADR-007: Append-Only Audit Logs

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a trustworthy chain of evidence for all actions.

## Decision
- Audit tables are **Append-Only**.
- **Redaction** of sensitive data occurs *before* writing to the database.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: High integrity; minimizes risk of leaking secrets in logs.
- **Negative**: Cannot "fix" a log entry if something was redacted incorrectly (data loss is intentional).

# ADR-009: MCP Gateway Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We want to support various Agentic frameworks (Claude Desktop, etc.) via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Decision
The **Agent Gateway** service will act as an MCP Server.
- It dynamically lists available Skills as Tools.
- It proxies Tool executions to the Execution Plane.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Native integration with the emerging MCP ecosystem.
- **Negative**: Maintenance of the MCP server layer.
